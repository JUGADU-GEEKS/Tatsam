# Image Placeholders

This file serves as a reference for image placeholders used in the website.

The following images should be added to the assets directory:

1. `about.jpg` - An image showing the Tatsam team or a relevant cultural activity
2. `member1.jpg`, `member2.jpg`, `member3.jpg`, `member4.jpg` - Profile photos of team members
3. `gallery1.jpg` through `gallery6.jpg` - Photos from past events and activities
4. `blog1.jpg`, `blog2.jpg`, `blog3.jpg` - Featured images for blog posts

You can replace these placeholders with actual images related to your society events and members.
